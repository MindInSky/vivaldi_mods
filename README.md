# Vivaldi Mods

## Current mods in use

- Addess bar in tab (saving space ftw) in this [comment](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/34187/merge-tabs-and-address-bar/50?lang=en-GB)
- Additional utils in panels ( On the fence on this one )[github link](https://github.com/LonMcGregor/VivaldiMods/blob/master/mods/panel_actions.js)

## Usage
Just pull inside the directory where mods should be located check the How to apply mods section for details
And select the mods folder when asked for the styles folder on the settings > appearance step

### Developing
Maybe? Vivaldi is not exactly on the rise so, who knows.

### Why do this?
I hate having to re-do things, I hate documenting too but its easier to back up stuff if you document it

### What are mods?
These are mods made to the Vivaldi browser by other users and this is my way of keeping them in a place
##### How to apply mods?
[Here](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi) is some documentation on that, still looking into how to make them myself
